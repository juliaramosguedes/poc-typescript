# Typescript Proof of Concept

This repository has 2 similar projects, one in Javascript and another in Typescript. Both of them have the same purpose, work with Pokemon's API and show the same pages. 

The objective of this POC is to prove the benefits of use Typescript instead of Javascript.

You can check the deployed project at [https://poke-ts.vercel.app/](https://poke-ts.vercel.app/).

For more information, there is a presentation here: [Typescript](https://www.canva.com/design/DAEatsSoCsk/s5SHE-VL3tfrgBP9F2rpnA/view?utm_content=DAEatsSoCsk&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=sharebutton).
